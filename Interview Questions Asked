Ques. AWS Services required, for deployment of a microservice based on hibernate and AWS.
Ans.  i)Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) - Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, 
distributed systems, and serverless applications.

ii)EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) 
provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 
Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as 
few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements 
or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
